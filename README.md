# Keysmith
Keysmith is an application to generate two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens when logging in to your (online) accounts. Currently it supports both HOTP and TOTP tokens.

Some todo items include:

 - QR code scanning
 - Backup and Restore of accounts

Originally this code was based largely on the [authenticator-ng](https://github.com/dobey/authenticator-ng) application by Rodney Dawes and Michael Zanetti for Ubuntu Touch.
