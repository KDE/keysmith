# Dummy CTest config file to help remind CMake/CTest to generate *all* files
# Otherwise you get warnings about some auto-generated files from CTest

# This file can apparently be 'empty'. It should not be removed without
# testing/checking everything still works, in particular test output
# logging/formatting.
